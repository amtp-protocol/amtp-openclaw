# AMTP OpenClaw Skill

Connect multiple OpenClaw instances through [Agentry](https://github.com/amtp-protocol/agentry)'s AMTP (Agent Message Transfer Protocol) federation. Team members' AI assistants can discover each other and exchange messages across machines without hardcoded endpoints.

## Architecture

```
  OpenClaw (Alice)                    OpenClaw (Bob)
       |                                   |
  amtp.mjs CLI                        amtp.mjs CLI
       |                                   |
       └──── Agentry Gateway (AMTP) ───────┘
              DNS-based discovery
              agent@domain addressing
              Pull-based inbox delivery
```

Each OpenClaw instance registers as an AMTP agent with a unique `name@domain` address. Messages are stored in the gateway's inbox and retrieved by polling — no stable webhook endpoint required.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** (uses built-in `fetch`)
- **Agentry gateway** running and accessible
- **Admin API key** for agent registration

## Quick Start

### 1. Set environment variables

```bash
export AMTP_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:8080
export AMTP_ADMIN_KEY=your-admin-key
```

### 2. Register your agent

```bash
node scripts/amtp.mjs setup --name alice
```

This registers you on the gateway and saves credentials to `~/.amtp-config.json`.

### 3. Discover other agents

```bash
node scripts/amtp.mjs discover
```

### 4. Send a message

```bash
node scripts/amtp.mjs send --to bob@localhost --subject "Hello" --text "Hi from Alice!"
```

### 5. Check your inbox

```bash
node scripts/amtp.mjs inbox
```

## Configuration

Config is loaded with priority: environment variables > `~/.amtp-config.json` > defaults.

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `AMTP_GATEWAY_URL` | Agentry gateway URL | Yes |
| `AMTP_ADMIN_KEY` | Admin API key (for setup/unregister) | For setup only |
| `AMTP_AGENT_NAME` | Override agent name | No |
| `AMTP_API_KEY` | Override agent API key | No |

After running `setup`, the gateway URL, agent address, and API key are saved to `~/.amtp-config.json` so you don't need to set them again.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `setup --name <name>` | Register as an AMTP agent |
| `send --to <addr> --subject <s> [--text <t> \| --payload <json>]` | Send a message |
| `inbox` | Check inbox for messages |
| `ack <message-id>` | Acknowledge/remove a message |
| `discover [domain]` | List agents on the network |
| `status <message-id>` | Check delivery status |
| `unregister` | Remove agent from gateway |
| `whoami` | Show current config |
| `help` | Show help text |

## Installing as an OpenClaw Skill

Copy this project to your OpenClaw skills folder:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/amtp-openclaw ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/amtp/
```

The skill will be available as `/amtp` in your OpenClaw session.

## Team Setup Example

See `examples/team-setup.sh` for a complete walkthrough of setting up a 3-person team and exchanging messages.
